Prompt
======

Prompt is a library for adding shell like interfaces to command line
applications.  It's intended to be similar to the interface used by some
networking equipment.


Features
--------

Prompt supports:
* built-in command completion
* history
* context sensitive completion
* command sets
* command output to a file
* command output filtering (e.g. 'grep')

Warning
-------
This library should be considered unstable for now.  Interfaces may change,
and your code may break as I add features and re-think existing features.
